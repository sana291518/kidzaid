KIDZAID

Project Overview
KIDZAID is a cutting-edge Android application designed to empower parents, children, and caregivers with vital first aid knowledge through dynamic and captivating teaching methods. Recognizing the critical importance of emergency preparedness, especially concerning common pediatric crises such as burns, wounds, choking, and allergic reactions, KIDZAID aims to bridge a significant gap in existing first aid training materials. The application provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions supplemented by video tutorials, ensuring users can respond appropriately in emergency situations. By incorporating interactive quizzes and gamification elements, KIDZAID not only boosts user engagement but also promotes deeper information retention, transforming the often dry subject of first aid into an engaging educational experience.
